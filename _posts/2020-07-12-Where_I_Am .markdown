After a lot of soul searching, I decided it is time to up my game as a Software Developer.

For a few months now, I have been noticing I am having trouble coming up with proper software solutoins to my tasks. In my PRs, I am always getting plenty of comments that indicate that I am not implementing the best practice principles i was taught.

So, I decided I need to improve. I searched for things to do to imprve as a Software Developer. To help me along my path, I devised a lists of things I need to work on:

- Best Practices:
    - SOLID principles
    - DRY principles
- Languages
- Frameworks
- Books
    - Clean Code
    - Complete Code
- A small starter projet in a language I am comfortable with
