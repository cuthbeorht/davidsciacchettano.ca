# Time Management

## Tips

### Have a Plan

It is a good idea to have a plan. At the beginning of the current day or the end of the day, plan for the upcoming day. I know I may be tired, but it might help.

Also, break up larger, insurmountable tasks into smaller ones. Take the time to plan out work and how to go about it. I tend to start coding waaaay too fast. This is a bad habit I picked up from Univserity.

### Prioritzie

Now that I have a plan, I can prioritize the tasks from `Hardest` to `Easiest`. It's better to do the harder ones in the moring since you are fresh.

### Divide and Conquer, and Perhaps Delegate

It makes sense to divide larger tasks. It allows tasks to be completed and have a sense of accomplishment.

And, don't be afraid to delegate to others.

### Plan Disruptive Periods

Or, the opposite, plan your free time and allow people to bother you only during that time.

### Multitasking is Evil

I tried it, I failed miserably. I am terrible at multitasking. It blew up in my face. I need to focus on my task and that is it.

### Be Disciplined

Practive what I preach.
